            Madrid's Altitude: Madrid is one of the highest capital cities in Europe, sitting at an average elevation of approximately 667 meters (2,188 feet) above sea level. <br>
             The city's high altitude contributes to its relatively dry and hot climate in the summer and cooler temperatures in the winter.

            El Rastro Market: Madrid hosts one of the largest and oldest flea markets in Europe, El Rastro. Held every Sunday and public holiday, El Rastro covers several city blocks in the La Latina neighborhood. <br>
             It's a bustling market where you can find a wide variety of items, including antiques, clothing, and unique souvenirs.

            The Bear and the Strawberry Tree: The symbol of Madrid is a bear reaching up to a strawberry tree, and you can find this emblem on the city's coat of arms. <br>
             This symbolizes the city's origin, as "Madrid" is believed to have derived from the Arabic "Magerit," which means "place of abundant water." The bear and strawberry tree are featured prominently in various places around the city, <br>
              such as the Puerta del Sol and the city's official flag.
